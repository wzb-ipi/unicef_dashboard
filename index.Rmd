Understanding the behavioural and social drivers of vaccination—vaccine acceptability, campaign awareness, risk perception, intent, refusals and reasons of refusals, and trusted information channels—is necessary to design effective vaccination policies. This dashboard provides disaggregated data on COVID-19 vaccine awareness, acceptability, perception, and barriers to mass vaccination.[^1^]
